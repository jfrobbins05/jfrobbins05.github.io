# Introduction to Microfluidic Devices and Applications 
Microfluidic devices are utilized to process small amounts of liquid (ex: 50 microliters) for medical applications. This processing can often take the form of mixing, sorting, or generating droplets with a microfluidic device and can be used for applications such as medical diagnostics, tissue engineering, pollution detection, or DNA sequencing. The device below is designed to sort particles based on size which can be applied to cells, viruses, sperm, blood components, fungal spores, metal particles, or extracellular vesicles.

# Introduction to PFF
This device utilizes Pinch Flow Fractination (PFF) to successfully sort particles.  PFF relies on laminar flow within the device in which streams of liquid flow parallel to each other with minimal, slow mixing, only from diffusion. This type of flow is possible as surface tension overwhelms typical forces on liquids such as gravity and inertia due to the high surface to volume ratio within microfluidic devices. This capillary action maintains the adhesive forces between the liquid and sides of the device, aiding in laminar flow.

PFF is superior to other filtering processes as it

# PFF Specifications and Dimensions
This application of PFF was designed with specifications in mind for particle size, successful sorting, and prevention of unwanted mixing. These specifications are as follows:
  1.  Overall size: The size of the device, 50 mm by 75 mm, was chosen to align with the size of an extra wide microscope slide. This size represents the upper end of microfluidic devices while still requiring minimal liquid compared to other medical devices.
  2.	Asymmetric Design and Channels Heights: An asymmetric design was chosen to sort the particles based on 
-	Height calculations
  3.	Flow Balance and Resistance: Based on particle and channel size discussed above, an uneven quantity of liquid is intended to flow into each channel. To keep flow consistent, allowing liquid to move through the device and to the outlet at an equal speed to avoid backflow, additional resistance was applied to channels to reduce flow rate. Calculations utilized to adjust resistance are seen below:
-	Resistance calculations
  4.	Channel Separation: Channels remained at least 1 mm apart to support the structure of the microfluidic device and not allow to make contact with each other
  5.	Channel buffer to wall: Channels were placed at least 3 mm from the edge of the mold so that the device has enough surface area to bond to the glass slide around the perimeter. This prevents leakage.
  6.	Device Height: The height of the device (excluding inlets and outlets) is 2 mm to 
  7.	Height of Ports:
  8.	Inlet/Outlet Width and Spacing:
  9.	Pinch Section:
  10.	Broad Section:
  11.	Filleting: Filleting was used along the channels to prevent the formation of bubbles which causes flow restriction 


# Developing a Usable Device
After being resin printed, molds undergo a multi-step process to be made into microfluidic devices that maintain their structure and are not cytotoxic. Instructions for said process are as follows:
  1.	Create a Resin Printed 3D Mold: Resin printing molds for microfluidic devices are significantly cheaper and more accessible than the lengthy and complex   lithography alternative.
  2.	Post-Process the Mold: The mold must be washed in isopropyl alcohol and post-cured with UV light and heat in order to fully polymerize the resin and ensure that that the part has enough stability to continue the subsequent processes.
  3.	Apply Parylene Coating: The mold must be coated in parylene-C utilizing vapor deposition techniques in order to provide a protective barrier during casting as leaching of monomers from resins can be cytotoxic to cells and cause material degradation.
  4.	Cast the Device: Mix PDMS and pour it into the mold. Then plasma treat it allowing covalent bonds to form and the material to harden before removal.
  5.	Seal the Device: The molded device is then sealed with a flat glass slide or another layer of PDMS on top to fully enclose the channels and prevent the device from leaking.
