The unique pairing of powder bed fusion and generative design and their 
applications in either aerospace or automotive industries. Please research a 
specific commercial example (not on the slides), where generative design has 
been used to reduce the number of components in an assembly.  
o The importance of applying the proper load cases and how to improve this 
process. How did you determine which forces to apply to the model? Where did 
you place the structural constraint and how will this placement affect the 
outcome? 
o A comparison between the nylon and aluminum outcome.  
o Critique generative design. How useful is it really? What are the drawbacks? 
What applications would generative design be most useful in?
